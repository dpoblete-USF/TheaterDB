# TheaterDB
A basic website running on a React JS frontend, Express backend, and PostGreSQL database that maintains information on theaters, movies, site users, and more.
## About
This project was created for COP4710 Database Design taught by Dr. Yicheng Tu at USF in Spring 2021. It is designed to allow users to connect to a very simple frontend and view/edit information within the database without needing additional software or needing to know PostGreSQL queries to do it. Multiple views (such as for managers, customers, employees, etc.) and a login system were considered at inception, but time constraints did not allow for them to be implemented.
